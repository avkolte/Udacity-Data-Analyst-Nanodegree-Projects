# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
## by Anup Kolte


## Dataset

> There are 113,937 loans in the dataset with 81 features. Most variables are numeric and categorical in nature. The dataset features can be 
split into two main categories:

> 1.Borrower information
  2.Loan performance information


## Summary of Findings

> In this dataset I have explored the attributes which are of my interest and found out some of the relationships between the varibales.

> In univariate exploration I have found out that term for loan is 36 months which has the most preference. Most of the loans are Current loans and followed by Completed loans and next Chargeoff and Defaulted loans, other loans are not that much.

> In bivariate exploration I have found out that The borrower APR and loan original amount correlation coefficient is negative this shows that these two variables are negatively correlated. We can see that smaller the prosper rating less loan original amount is there and higher interest rate. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR



## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on the journey of exploring the features of interest to discover which attributes are realted with one another and how they are relatedd.

> I begin with introducing the features of interest one by one, follwed by how they correlate with on another also my main focus was on Prosper rating, borrower APR and loan amount.
